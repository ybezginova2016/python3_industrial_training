'''
This program can hack messages encrypted 
with the Caesar cipher from the previous project, even 
if you donâ€™t know the key. There are only 26 
possible keys for the Caesar cipher, so a computer can easily try all possible decryptions and display the results to the user. In cryptography, we call 
this technique a brute-force attack.
